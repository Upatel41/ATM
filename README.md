Project4.py is a python ATM. The user enters a four digit PIN number and has the option to withdraw or deposit cash into their accounts. If the user selects to deposit python will update their account balance and print the new balance but if the user wishes to withdraw python will show the amount of bills being dispensed and also show their new updated balance. PIN numbers are 4 digit numbers and if a PIN number not associated with an account is entered then an error message will display. Project4.py needs 2 json files in order to work. Those two files are cards.json and accounts.json. cards.json has the PIN number associated with a name, account number, and card number. While accounts.json has the balance for each account number and updates as users withdraw and deposit. In order to test Project4.py you must open the cards.json file and pick any of the 4 digit PIN numbers. From there you can withdraw or deposit and account balances will be changed. You will receive a confirmation test that shows if the balance was added succesfully.
